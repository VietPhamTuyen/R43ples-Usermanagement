R43ples
=======

R43ples (Revision for triples) is Revision Management Tool for the Semantic Web.

It is based on storing the differences of revisions of graphs in additional Named Graphs which are then referenced in a revision graph. It provides an extended SPARQL interface which offers the possibility specify revision of named graphs which should be used for answering the query.

This project provides a service for revision management of named graphs in a triple store.
The service can be interconnected in front of an existing SPARQL endpoint of a Triple Store. 
This service in the associated Triple Store creates and manages a revision management of graphs. 
It provides a SPARQL endpoint where all queries have to be directed to. 
The SPARQL query defines whether only a revision is queried, or a new revision needs to be created. 
Furthermore, the service provides an interface for revision management and the import or export of data from the Computer Aided Engineering tools.

The javadoc can be found at the [website](http://plt-tud.github.io/r43ples) under [http://plt-tud.github.io/r43ples/javadoc/](http://plt-tud.github.io/r43ples/javadoc/).

A running test server should be available under [http://eatld.et.tu-dresden.de:9998/r43ples/sparql](http://eatld.et.tu-dresden.de:9998/r43ples/sparql)

Dependencies
------------
* JDK 1.7
* Running Triplestore with SPARQL 1.1 endpoint (tested with Virtuoso 7)


Releases
--------
Releases are stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/plt-tud/r43ples/releases).
They just have to be unzipped and started with Java

	unzip R43ples.zip
    java -jar R43ples.jar
    
Compiling
---------
Ant is used for compiling

    ant run
    
Releases can be be built with:

    ant zip
    
    
Configuration
-------------
There is a configuration file named *resources/r43ples.conf* where all parameters are configured:

* *sparql.endpoint* - SPARQL endpoint of triplestore which stores all information
* *sparql.username* - username for connected SPARQL endpoint allowed to write data
* *sparql.password* - password for specified user
* *revision.graph* - named graph which is used by R43ples to store revision graph information
* *service.port* - port under which R43ples provides its services
* *service.uri* - URI under which R43ples provides its services

The logging configuration is stored in *resources/log4j.properties*


Interfaces
---------
SPARQL endpoint is available at:

    [uri]:[port]/r43ples/sparql

The endpoint directly accepts SPARQL queries with HTTP GET parameters for *query* and *format*: 

    [uri]:[port]/r43ples/sparql?query=[]&format=(HTML|JSON)

There are some additional keywords which can be used to control the revisions of graphs:

* Create graph

        CREATE GRAPH <graph>
        
* Select query

        SELECT * FROM <graph> REVISION "23" WHERE {?s ?p ?o}
        
* Update query

        USER "mgraube" MESSAGE "test commit" 
        INSERT {
            GRAPH <test> REVISION "2" {
                <a> <b> <c> .
            }
        }

* Branching

        USER "mgraube"
        MESSAGE "test commit"
        BRANCH GRAPH <test> REVISION "2" TO "unstable"
        
* Tagging

        USER "mgraube"
        MESSAGE "test commit"
        TAG GRAPH <test> REVISION "2" TO "v0.3-alpha"


SPARQL Join option
------------------
There is a new option for R43ples which improves the performance. The necessary revision is not temporarily generated anymore.
The SPARQL query is rewritten in such a way that the branch and the change sets are directly joined inside the query. This includes the order of the change sets.
It is currently under development and further research.

The option can be enabled by:

```
OPTION r43ples:SPARQL_JOIN
```

It currently supports:

* Multiple Graphs
* Multiple TriplePath
* FILTER
* MINUS

For more details, have a look into the *doc/* directory.


Algorithm
-----------
Without SPARQL Join option the algorithms are very simple:
    
```
For each named graph 'g' in a query, a temporary graph 'TempGraph_g_r' is generated for the specified revision 'r' according to this formula ('g_x' = full materialized revision 'x' of graph 'g'):
    TempGraph_g_r = g_nearestBranch + SUM[revision i= nearestBranch to r]( deleteSet_g_i - addSet_g_i )
```

```
def select_query(query_string):
    for (graph,revision) in query_string.get_named_graphs_and_revisions():   
        execQuery("COPY GRAPH <"+graph+"> TO GRAPH <tmp-"+graph+"-"+revision+">")
        for rev in graph.find_shortest_path_to_revision(revision):
            execQuery("REMOVE GRAPH "+ rev.add_set_graph+" FROM GRAPH <tmp-"+graph+"-"+revision+">")
            execQuery("ADD GRAPH "+ rev.delete_set_graph+" TO GRAPH <tmp-"+graph+"-"+revision+">")
        query_string.replace(graph, "tmp-"+graph+"-"+revision)
    result = execQuery(query_string)
    execQuery("DROP GRAPH <tmp-*>")
    return result
```
  
``` 
def update_query(query_string):
    for (graph,revision) in query_string.get_named_graphs_and_revisions():
        newRevision = revision +1
        execQuery("ADD GRAPH "+ rev.delete_set_graph+" TO GRAPH <tmp-"+graph+"-"+revision+">")
        ...
```
